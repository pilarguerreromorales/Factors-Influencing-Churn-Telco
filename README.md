#  Factors Influencing Churn in Telco

This repository contains the final project for **AI & ML Foundations**, focusing on predicting customer churn in a fictional telecommunications company (Telco). The project applies machine learning techniques to analyze customer behavior and identify key drivers of churn, enabling businesses to improve retention strategies.

## Project Overview

Customer churn is a critical issue in the telecom industry, as acquiring new customers is 5‚Äì7x more costly than retaining existing ones. This project builds models to predict churn and evaluate factors influencing it.

- **Objective**: Identify features that increase the probability of churn and provide interpretable results to guide business strategy.
- **Approach**: 
  - Data preprocessing, feature engineering, and merging external datasets (zip codes & income levels).
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to assess variables, outliers, and correlations.
  - Hypothesis-driven evaluation of factors such as contract type, gender-income interactions, payment method, and satisfaction.
  - Modeling with **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forests**, prioritizing **recall** to minimize false negatives (missed churners).

## üî¨ Key Findings

- **Supported Hypotheses**:
  - Customers with **monthly contracts** are more likely to churn.
  - Customers with **multiple services churn more** if their satisfaction drops below 3.

- **Rejected Hypotheses**:
  - Gender-income interaction effects were negligible.
  - Mailed check payments did not increase churn risk.

- **Model Choice**:
  - **Logistic Regression** was selected over Random Forest due to:
    - Better interpretability of coefficients.
    - Comparable performance (recall ‚âà 0.96 on test set).
    - Reduced reliance on single dominant features (e.g., satisfaction score).
